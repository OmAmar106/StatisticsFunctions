--------------------------------------------Statistics-Functions-Solver-------------------------------------------------

The main  .py file is inside the Statistics Question Solver folder.

I made this project to make it easier for me to calculate very lengthy statistics problem given to me in my college.

This program consists of 14 functions that would help you in questions related to statistics. It has been made completely only using 
Python.

You can directly import a xlsx file in case there is a table stored in that file format and you can directly perform applications on 
the table.

The program will need to be customized based on how you want to use it.

Functions that have been made in the Program:

1. Table Maker:
This creates a table in a xlsx file format that can be used to then perform operations on that require a table.

2. Table Reader:
In case you already have a table, you can use this function.

3. Mean:
Takes a table as input and reads the table followed by printing the mean of the table.

4. Linear Percentile:
Prints the position you would be at if you have the percentile and the sample size.

5. Table Percentile:
Gives the percentile directly from the table.

6. Sample Variance:
Gives the variance after taking input as a table.

7. Sample Standard Deviation:
Uses the sample variance function and returns its root.

9. Expected Value:
Gives the expected in a table, which is quite similar to the mean function.

10. Variance:
Gives the variance with a table as input.

11. Binomial Random Variable:
Calculates the binomial random variable,Expected Value and Variance

12. Standard Normal Probablity:
Uses an image in the same directory as the .py file to find the standardized normal probablity(as it has predefined values).

13. Standard Normal Probablity using cetral limit theorem:
Does the same thing , but using central limit theorem.
